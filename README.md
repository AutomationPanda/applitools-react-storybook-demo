# Visually Testing Storybook Components in React with Applitools Eyes

This repository contains a demo project for visually testing
[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) components
in a [React](https://reactjs.org/) front-end app
with [Applitools Eyes](https://applitools.com/products-eyes/).

What does all that mean?

* [React](https://reactjs.org/) is a JavaScript library for building websites.
* [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) is a tool for creating components to build UIs for websites.
* [Visual testing](https://applitools.com/visual-testing/) detects visual changes in UIs,
  like improper formatting or missing elements.
* [Applitools Eyes](https://applitools.com/products-eyes/) automates visual testing to help folks
  quickly identify real problems while skipping acceptable changes.

The best part is that Applitools Eyes will perform visual testing on Storybook components
*without* needing to write any extra test code yourself!

This README walks through the demo.
Please clone the project and follow along!
